# Neural network from scratch

Implement a neural network (with one hidden layer) for multiclass classification.
The implementation is done with only numpy. 
The calculation used to implement front propagation, back propagation and gradient descent are shown in the pdf file.
The neural network correclty classifies 100% of the test set on the circles dataset
