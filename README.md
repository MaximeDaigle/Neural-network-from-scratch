# Neural network from scratch


Implement a neural network for classification with only numpy. 
The calculation used to implement front propagation, back propagation and gradient descent are shown in the pdf file.

Parameters:
hidden_dims=(512, 256),
number of classes=10,
learning rate=7e-4,
batch_size=1000,
seed=0,
activation="relu", "sigmoid" or "tanh"
init_method="glorot"
